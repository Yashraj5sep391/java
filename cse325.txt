In window, it is a menu-based OS. It means that for every action there is 
an option available on screen.

Windows uses backslash ('\') as the directory separator, while Linux uses forward slash ('/') as the directory separator.
• In Linux it is a command-based OS. For preforming an action, we must
write a command.
• Windows provide us both facilities. Either complete a process by using 
menu options or use the cmd.
